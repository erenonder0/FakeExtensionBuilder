# FakeExtensionBuilder

A small tool that inserts the **Braille Pattern Blank (U+2800)** character between the filename and the `.exe` extension when renaming `.exe` files to disguise the file extension.

## Features

- Keeps the `.exe` extension but adds an invisible space (Braille Pattern Blank) between the filename and the extension.
- Makes the file appear like `payload.mp4â €.exe`, camouflaging the actual file type.
- Provides a simple and quick way to rename files while hiding their true extension.

## Usage

1. Run the application.
2. Select the file.
3. Enter a new name and extension (e.g., `.mp4`).
4. Click the Apply button.
5. The filename is changed to the new name, with the `.exe` extension hidden by an invisible character.

## Purpose

This project is designed for developers or security researchers who want to manipulate file names to camouflage file types.
